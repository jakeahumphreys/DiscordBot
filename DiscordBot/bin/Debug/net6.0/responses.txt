Have you tried turning it off and on again?
I reccommend rubbing it with coconut oil or something.
Sorry we're closed.
Yeah I bet you'd like some support wouldn't you.
Try wiping it gently with some water. If that doesn't work put it in the sink.
I'm not legally allowed to provide support for that.
The manual doesn't account for that, sorry.
